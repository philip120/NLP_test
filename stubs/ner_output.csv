137,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 A Town of Outlaws!                           The Shadow of the Fuma Clan
 It seems that the most bustling traveler’s town in the Land of Rice Paddies
 is at the bottom of these mountains.
 You’re going to weird places again
 in the name of investigation, aren’t you, Pervy Sage?!
 Please stop it already!
 We had a rough time shaking off the bodyguards from the rip-off bar.
 I understand your point,
 but there’s no other way to find Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Gee, I don’t like it either, but…
 This is truly a problem…
 But we have to do things we don’t like… Right?!
 Okay, let’s go!
 Naruto, Sakura, don’t drag your feet!
 Investigation, investigation! What a pain.
 He looks like he’s having fun.
 He hasn’t learned at all.
 Fuma Alley
 – Oww! 					– That's my line!
 This is even rougher than the traveler’s town before.
 Let’s just take a pass on this place and find Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Say…
 I don’t have any more money.
 I don’t have any more money either!
 Here!
 You guys go get some food with that
 and wait in the temple on the outskirts of town.
 Information accumulates in this kind of place,
 but it’s not good for you guys to see.
 I’ll sacrifice myself and check it out.
 He’s a surprisingly nice person…
 Sakura… You’re still so naïve.
 Where should I investigate first?
 Gee, how rough… lnvestigations are painful.
 Let’s leave the Pervy Sage be and check somewhere else.
 What’s the matter, Sakura?
 I don’t think… Sasuke’s in this land anymore.
 What’s the matter?!
 We won’t know that if we don’t investigate!
 Yeah, but…
 Our opponent is Orochimaru.
 Of course, things might not go easily.
 But you know…
 But I’m sure we’ll find him!
 Right.
 Naruto!
 You’re…the one from before?!
 This kid’s…hurt…
 You…?
 Naruto!
 Substitution, huh…?
 We let them get away.
 Don’t worry…
 My cute children are making a silver trail for us.
 They can’t escape from us now…
 It seems those two are petty Ninja from somewhere.
 But getting involved with us has sealed their fate.
 It’s unfortunate for them…
 The objective of those who sneak into this land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.
 Sure enough, the skin of a young woman is supple.
 You’re mean!
 Eh? Oh, sorry sorry.
 By the way, have you guys heard rumors about the Sound Village?
 The Sound Village?
 I’ve never heard the name of such a village.
 I’ll tip you handsomely if you tell me.
 But I really don’t know.
 I’ve never heard of it.
 I’ve heard of it!
 One of my regulars knows a lot about it.
 Wanna come?
 Yeah.
 His home is in the back of this alley.
 Trapped like a rat.
 What, it’s a seedy old man! Hey! He’s got money, right?
 Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.
 You punks! Stop the idle chatter and take care of him now!
 Right, boss!
 Getting infatuated with girls has sealed your fate! Rest in peace!
 Ninja Art: 					Needle Jizo.
 You punk…
 I’m in a hurry…
 I think it’d be best if you answer compliantly
 whether or not you know about Hidden Sound Village.
 You’re a fool if I look like a compliant person to you!
 You a Ninja?
 If so?
 Interesting!
 We’ve reduced ourselves to being thieves,
 but we’re a somewhat famous Shinobi clan around here!
 Instead of taking your life, I could hire you if you want!
 A Ninja, huh…
 Then I don’t need to go easy on you.
 Don’t be acting like a big shot, old man!
 Shut up, you squirt!
 A Ninja refers to one who endures.
 Those who couldn’t endure their hunger pangs
 and resort to use their diligently studied Jutsu for stealing
 are not called Ninja!
 I won’t let that pass!
 Thinking we’re fellow Shinobi, we took pity on you.
 Acting all conceited!
 Regret after being sliced in two!
 Fuma Ninja Blade Zanbato!
 Rasengan!
 You punk! How dare you do that to the boss!
 We won’t let you do any more than that!
 Oh?
 Hold it, you guys!
 I didn’t know you were so good!
 That Jutsu just now…
 I sense you must be a person of stature!
 If it’s all right, may I ask you your name?
 If you don’t know, then I shall tell you!
 Women become infatuated with his sex appeal.
 He’s strong against Shinobi, but has a soft spot for women!
 He exists in Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 And made his name known…
 Master Jiraiya, that’s me!
 What?!
 You guys bow your heads and beg for your lives!
 We’ll all be killed!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Although we didn’t know, being so rude to Master Jiraiya,
 reputed as one of the Legendary Sannin of the Leaf Village!
 We beg for your forgiveness!
 So my name’s known in this land, too…
 Well, it’s okay.
 So is it true that you know about Village Hidden in the Sound?
 Yes! There were many Ninja clans in the Land of Rice Paddies,
 including us Fuma.
 We divided up the roles amongst ourselves
 and the Ninja of this land were doing well in their own way.
 Until that man appeared…
 Who was that man?
 It’s regrettable to even speak of that name…
 It was Orochimaru!
 It’s okay! Rest easy!
 If germs get into the wound and you get tetanus,
 you won’t be saved.
 But fortunately, I have medicine, so let me treat you.
 They’re not coming.
 Just show us your wound.
 Well, huh?
 Naruto, go wait outside till my treatment is done. 164.01	01:37:53:04	01:37:53:24	Huh?
 Why do I have to be the only one chased out?!
 Jeez!
 I guess it can’t be helped.
 Don’t peek!
 I know.
 Okay, show me your wound.
 How mean…
 To hit me out of the blue…?
 Whoa, interesting.
 Naruto! You can come in!
 What?!
 A cute girl?
 Sakura! This girl! Who the heck is this girl?!
 How dense. It’s the Ninja from a moment ago.
 Come to think of it…
 Why…?
 I am Sasame Fuma.
 Sasame… Why were you being chased by those guys?
 If you like, try talking about it.
 We might be able to help.
 They were the Sound Ninja protecting Orochimaru’s residence.
 What?!
 I’m sorry for mistaking you guys as one of them the other day.
 That doesn’t matter!
 We’re also looking for Orochimaru!
 Would you please give us the details?
 Okay…
 It all started with the Feudal Lord of the Land of Rice Paddies
 launching an attack on a neighboring land
 in an attempt to expand the territory.
 The Land of Rice Paddies is a small land…
 And there aren’t that many Shinobi.
 It was a foolhardy attack. Losing was expected…
 And the Shinobi clans of this land
 who participated in the losing battle went to ruin…
 We the Fuma Clan as well.
 I hear that among the surviving Shinobi,
 there are those who have left the land
 and those who have stooped to become thieves.
 Even so, we’ve lived believing in a restoration of the clan
 and continued to live hiding in the shadows.
 At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden in the Sound appeared before us
 attempting to create the first full-scale Shinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies.
 The emissary of the Sound Village said…
 My master Orochimaru is gathering all sorts of Jutsu!
 He has taken an interest in your Jutsu well.
 Depending on your work,
 you might be given the chance to serve the Feudal Lord!
 My cousin Arashi…
 was an up-and-coming star for the restoration of the clan…
 Arashi as a representative of the clan
 headed for Village Hidden in the Sound together with the emissary.
 But…
 And then…?
 We waited for a notice from Arashi, but…
 There is no word from him, huh?
 Damn it! He was tricked by that Orochimaru!
 Naruto!
 Oh…!
 Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi might be safe…
 We don’t know, right? And so…and so…
 Idiot…!
 I’m going to save Arashi!
 I have a small body and my power is weak.
 So no matter what I did…
 I did nothing but become a hindrance even in Ninjutsu training…
 But Arashi always saved me!
 Everyone in the village has already given up, but…
 So I’ll find Village Hidden in the Sound alone…
 And so you were chased by the Sound Ninja, right?
 This time, it’s my turn to save Arashi!
 Sasame!
 I…I want to be of help to Arashi!
 Naruto!
 Yeah…I know!
 We have to go to Village of the Sound to bring back Sasuke anyway, so!
 Now instead of one,
 it’s just that there are two guys for us to bring back.
 I’ll save your cousin, Sasame!
 Right!
 Eew! A spider…
 What’s this?!
 Naruto!
 Wha--! What’s this?!
 Ninja Art: Wind Spiders!
 My cute children made a path for me out of silver thread
 and told me where you guys were going.
 All three of you together will descend into hell while bearing the secret!
 Naruto! It’s the Ventriloquism Jutsu!
 He’s scattering his voice to multiple directions
 and covering up location and number!
 I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!
 It’s a large number, but it’s just Clone Jutsu.
 No. Look closely, Jigumo!
 The threads are getting tangled.
 All of the clones are tangible?! Shadow clones?!
 If so… Kagero!
 Understood…
 Come out!
 Borne to be born, lived to live, one sunrise and one sunset…
 The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.
 Thinking that such a fleeting life is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable…
 Know that I’m at my best
 when living in the dark and deep in the ground!
 Ninja Art:
 Ant Lion Jutsu!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Darn it! What a pesky bunch!
 But I won’t be done in so easily!
 I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk’s butt
 and bring back Sasuke and Sasame’s cousin!
 It doesn’t matter if you guys are powerhouses!
 I’ll kick all of your butts, so bring it on from anywhere!

 Okay, pull him up!
 There, eh?!
 Damn! Was it a clone?!
 Over here!
 Counterattack, here it comes!
 Rasengan, go!
 What--?!
 You little…!
 Yes!
 Be careful, Naruto! There are two others hiding!
 Hey, there they are!
 Kagero!
 Let’s retreat for now!
 Hold it!
 Th-They’re totally quick at running away!
 Naruto, why’re you spacing out?!
 Where’s Sakura?
 Oh! Oh, no!
 Sakura!
 Oh! Naruto…
 Thank goodness! You’re okay, Sasame.
 Yes… Sasame’s okay.
 Sasame's totally okay.
 What’re you mad about?
 Let’s take a break here.
 Sakura…Who’s the cute girl?
 Okay! That’s close enough…
 What’s the deal…Sakura?
 Okay, don’t come any closer!
 Wh-What… I’m only interested in adult women!
 You must not misunderstand…!
 Don’t misunderstand!
 It’s not a misunderstanding.
 It seems Sakura’s finally figured out Pervy Sage’s true nature!
 I told you to stop calling me a “Pervy Sage”!
 Then you’re the Lewd Sage!
 Both of you stop it! Sasame’s scared!
 – Okay. 					– Okay.
 Jeez…
 This girl is Sasame…
 She’s a Ninja from the Land of Rice Paddies…
 A member of the Fuma Clan.
 She had her cousin taken away by Orochimaru
 and was looking for his hideout.
 Right. And the Ninja just now were after Sasame
 in order to protect the secret of the hideout!
 Oh…With the Fuma Clan, huh?
 Huh?! You know?
 I had contact with Ninja in the town who’d left the Fuma Clan.
 What! So you were actually doing some serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!
 I-I can’t believe it…!
 Well you see, when I went to this nice-looking bar,
 it just turned out to be their hideout.
 What! So after all, you were just hanging out with some girls, right?
 You mustn’t talk in a way that’ll lead to a misunderstanding!
 Even Sakura who respects me will…
 I’ve long since stopped respecting you!
 I…I see…
 Members of the Fuma Clan…?
 Yeah. The boss was called Hanzaki or something…
 Hanzaki and the others are traitors who abandoned the clan.
 Oh…
 Did those people do something?
 They were after my travel money, so I taught them a lesson.
 While at it, I attempted to ask them about Orochimaru’s hideout…
 but they didn’t know anything.
 I can show you the way to Orochimaru’s hideout.
 For real?!
 Yes…
 All right!
 Your wound hasn’t healed yet. Don’t push yourself.
 Yes…but…
 This is the entrance to the Village Hidden in Sound.
 Orochimaru’s hideout is deep in those mountains…
 I bet Sasuke is somewhere in those mountains…
 Okay, at last!
 Let’s hurry!
 Well, hold on…
 Why?!
 If we don’t hurry, night will fall before we arrive at Orochimaru’s hideout…
 That’s right!
 Sasuke is just a stone’s throw away! Pervy Sage!
 If we’re going to save him, we should do it as soon as possible!
 Why do we have to wait?!
 Huh…?
 What?
 Gee…
 Well…I’m hungry, you see…
 You know… All Shinobi must …
 I can’t fight if I’m hungry!
 Up ahead will become full-blown enemy territory.
 We won’t have time to have relaxed meals, so…
 Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat!
 Mm, this is good…
 You prepared this especially for us?
 No. It seems the prettiest girl in the bar fell to my charm, you see.
 She made these with tender loving care.
 I’ll go make some tea.
 Oh…thanks…
 Tastes pretty good.
 Tea is ready.
 Here you go!
 Here you go.
 Thanks…
 Here you go.
 Thank you, Sasame…
 Sasame, you should come here and eat with us, too.
 Okay…
 Pervy Sage…What’s wrong…?!
 Naruto…!
 Sasame did it…
 Since it’s come to this, they’re ours.
 Your wound still hasn’t healed.
 Kagero, you wait here.
 No mistake…They’re Leaf Ninja.
 If we take care of the Leaf pursuers…
 Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge the power of the Fuma Clan.
 Yeah…
 Let’s come back with good news.
 And with the heads of the Leaf Ninja as souvenirs!
 I finally found it!
 At first, I thought it was someone from the Hidden Leaf Village.
 But it’s Sasame, believe it or not…
 Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero…
 This is an odd reunion.
 Where’s Arashi?! He wasn’t with all you guys?!
 Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru and is spending his days training.
 Can I see Arashi?!
 If you’re also going to work together with us for Lord Orochimaru,
 I’m sure you’ll be able to see him.
 How’d it go?
 You’ve done well.
 With this, I’ll be able to see Arashi, right?
 After we’ve finished them off!
 Why?! Weren’t we just supposed to take them to Lord Orochimaru
 for examination after capturing them?!
 We only need the heads for the examination.
 No!
 These people… For my sake…!
 Move it!
 – Wha--?! 					– Huh?!
 What?!
 The Fuma numbing medicine didn’t work!
 We knew about it all along from the beginning!
 Sakura!
 Substitution…?!
 I leave Sasame to you!
 Leave her to me!
 Sasame… Hang in there!
 Why…? Why does Sasame have to do something like this?!
 No, it’s not that she’s doing it against her will…!
 It’s something she wanted to do!
 Liar!
 It’s true…
 What…
 What should I do to be able to see Arashi again?
 It’s not a difficult thing.
 You just have to put the lights out of those who infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.
 We have to kill them…?!
 We’ll take them back to Lord Orochimaru for examination.
 So we’re not going to kill, right?
 If we carry out that work, Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.
 Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone are being tricked by Orochimaru.
 He says that you’ll just be used and thrown away…
 Hanzaki’s just a traitor who abandoned the village.
 Will you believe what we say?
 Or will you believe what a traitor says?
 Lord Orochimaru will surely restore our Fuma Clan…
 Sasame, although you’re still young, you’re also one of the Fuma.
 Assist in the restoration of our Fuma Clan…
 So you guys did trick Sasame!
 It’s all for the restoration of the Fuma Clan!
 You little!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Here I go!
 Wha--!
 U-zu-ma-ki…!
 Naruto Barrage!
 This is bad…!
 Rasengan!
 This is for Sasame. Prepare yourselves!
 Naruto!
 You’re…from before?!
 The Earth Style Jutsu user in question, huh?
 However, there’s no point to using that Art in this rocky area.
 Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from inside the ground
 and the spreading of its wings under the sunlight is
 but a momentary gleam.
 That’s when I die as Kagero!
 Be careful!
 What’s this…?
 Look! Naruto…
 Wha--?!
 U-Unbelievable!
 You were a woman…?!
 The clan will once again be in a place lit by the sunlight…
 Lord Orochimaru promised that…
 I’ll use this once-in-a-lifetime Art if it’s for the sake of that.
 Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!
 Naruto! Come with me!
 Naruto!
 I-I feel like…I’ve seen this before…
 It’s Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.
 I summoned the extraordinarily sturdy stomach of
 the Mount Myoboku’s lwajuku Giant Toad.
 Stomach…?
 Yikes!
 It’s melting…
 If I didn’t do this,
 we wouldn’t have been able to defend ourselves from her Chakra.
 I believed…that the clan would someday…
 I believed in that.
 Sh-She vanished.
 I’ve got to hand it to her.
 She probably put all of her life on the line
 and attempted to save her comrades…
 It’s unforgivable!
 Those guys… 					the Fuma Ninja…
 Their feelings toward the clan is the same as our feelings!
 Manipulating the Fuma’s desire to restore their clan…
 I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt, no matter what!
 Wh-Where are we?
 Kagero…!
 You risked your life to save us?
 You idiot…
 Please…
 Please use your Medical Ninjutsu to save her.
 Our comrade doesn’t have long to live!
 Put your hands to your chests and think.
 Think about what you weren’t able to accomplish…okay?
 We risked our lives working for you… to help you, Lord Orochimaru.
 In order to restore the Fuma Clan!
 Please recognize our work!
 You’ll just have to atone for your failure with your bodies.
 Lord Orochimaru!
 I’m sorry for the betrayal!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 That’s Orochimaru’s residence!
 It really is just like him to construct his residence underground.
 Sasuke is somewhere inside that residence, right?
 Sakura, let’s hurry!
 Right!
 Be careful! First Avenue of hell is up ahead!
 Will a devil appear, or will a snake appear?
 Heh! I’m looking forward to it!
 I’ll kick the butts of the devil and the snake.
 And I’ll save Sasuke and Arashi!

203,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Sure enough, I just can’t get into training by myself.
 As for the Pervy Sage…
 I wonder what he’s doing and where?
 And what happened to him watching my training?! Damn it!
 What’s she doing?
 Wow, are you painting a picture?
 Huh?!
 There’s nothing like rain clouds in the sky.
 Wha--?
 The Hokage’s house!
 Hurry! Get a move on.
 Water, water, water!
 Right away!
 – Water Style! – Water Style!
 – Marine Battle Formation Jutsu! – Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
 Whoa! You idiots. Not me, up on the roof!
 We’re very sorry!
 Right, keep it up.
 Yes, ma’am!
 As I thought, the thing I had feared has happened…
 Kurenai's Decision: Squad 8 Left Behind
 There she is.
 Hey! Wait up!
 Giving us trouble.
 Let’s hurry up and take her back.
 Right.
 Hey, wait!
 What’re you guys doing?!
 Anbu Black Ops?!
 Naruto Uzumaki, leave this place immediately.
 Huh?!
 As for her, what’d she do?
 It doesn’t concern you.
 Listen up. Don’t breathe a word of what you saw here.
 Knock it off! Just a minute!
 Don’t get in our way!
 Oh! They vanished…
 Damn it! What’s going on?!
 Oh, important documents are soaked.
 This will have to be dried in the sun.
 I’ll take them outside.
 Thanks.
 ‘Morning.
 Oh, Kurenai Sensei.
 Is the Fifth Hokage in?
 Yes.
 So? Is there no change to your sentiment about pulling out of Squad 8?
 No.
 Think about it carefully.
 Kiba, Shino, Hinata…
 You’re the one who recommended those guys lacking in experience
 for the Chunin Exam.
 You don’t care about them?
 But I must not leave that problem unresolved.
 It’s my responsibility, so…
 That incident was no fault of yours.
 If the Anbu Black Ops are involved, then is she a considerably bad person?
 Or was she involved in some kind of significant incident?
 What did you say?!
 Calm down, Kiba.
 Kiba, Hinata?
 Hey, Shino. Say that again!
 Very well. I said it’d be futile.
 How dare you say something like that…!
 Cut it out!
 Naruto.
 Calm down. What the hell’s wrong?
 We in Squad 8 were left high and dry by Kurenai Sensei.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 You see, Sensei spoke to us directly about it.
 My duty is completed.
 You will probably be provided with another Jonin in charge eventually.
 Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei.
 Sensei…
 It’s written in stone.
 Our relationship is just that of commander and subordinate.
 It’s just the team formation changing as circumstances demand.
 And that was that. She didn’t even give us a reason.
 That was that? Are you guys going to accept that?
 Hell no! That’s why I’m saying we should march into the Hokage’s office and
 protest why she is removing Kurenai Sensei from our Squad 8!
 Then this Shino says…
 I’m saying it’s futile.
 It’s because this might be something she herself decided on.
 Pig-headed jerk…!
 Hinata, what do you think?
 I also want Kurenai Sensei to stay as our Jonin in charge…
 But…
 But what?!
 Kurenai Sensei might have some kind of reason of her own…
 Umm…
 So you’re the same as Shino, huh?
 No… Kiba!
 Just stop fighting already. I’ll do something about this.
 Naruto, you’re not even on this team.
 What’re you going to do?
 Leave it to me.
 I won’t let Kurenai Sensei quit, no matter what.
 I blurted out that they can leave it to me, but I don’t know.
 Hm?
 Kurenai Sensei.
 What’s she doing?
 All right, I should ask her directly.
 Umm, Sensei.
 Naruto.
 I heard from Kiba and the others.
 What?
 Don’t give up being in charge of Squad 8.
 They’re really depressed.
 That’s why you went to the trouble of coming?
 Yeah. It seems they really revere you.
 I don’t know what you heard from those kids,
 but I can’t do that.
 I don’t deserve to.
 Deserve?
 Please tell them all for me. Tell them I’m never coming back.
 Sensei.
 Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all.
 Since it’s come to this, I guess I’ll try Grandma Tsunade directly.
 Naruto.
 Sakura!
 What is it?
 Kurenai Sensei says she’s going to quit Squad 8,
 so I’m going to try asking Grandma Tsunade directly.
 I think that’d be useless… Probably.
 It’ll be okay.
 As for me, I know the place where she keeps her alcohol hidden,
 so if I threaten to reveal it to Shizune…
 What I meant was that she must have some good reason for quitting.
 What? What? By any chance, do you know something, Sakura?
 Huh?
 You know something, right? Tell me.
 No, don’t know anything.
 Come on, tell me!
 You’re a pest.
 Would I ever do something like eavesdrop on someone’s important talk?
 What? You eavesdropped?
 Yikes!
 You idiot. Don’t talk so loud!
 Yakumo?
 Yeah. If I remember correctly, that’s what she said.
 I am at fault for letting Yakumo become like that.
 No, I’d say instead that she was fine up until now
 because I put her in your custody…
 Shizune, how’re the nursing arrangements?
 A three-man team consisting of
 two Medical Ninja and one Anbu Black Ops member
 are keeping a 24-hour watch over her in a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill.
 Even so, you can’t rest easy?
 No.
 I want to take responsibility in my own way.
 Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morning…
 The conditions are spot-on.
 What was the girl’s name again?
 Yakumo.
 Yakumo. Thanks, Sakura.
 Hey, Naruto. Don’t tell anyone I said anything!
 Yeah, I know.
 If that girl is Yakumo,
 then she might know something about Kurenai Sensei.
 Lee, you are not stepping in deep enough.
 Right.
 Kurenai Yuhi.
 I make this request with full confidence
 that you are the best practitioner of Genjutsu in this village.
 Could you take charge of that girl?
 Who’s this girl?
 Yakumo Kurama.
 You know about the Kurama Clan, don’t you?
 Yes.
 At one time, they were a clan excelling in Genjutsu
 and were a power in the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 in the same way as the Uchiha Clan.
 But they haven’t been blessed in recent years with talent,
 their force has weakened and
 they have not been able to turn out Jonin-class Shinobi.
 Yakumo Kurama is the Kurama…
 Yes… She’s the only daughter of the Murakumo of the head family.
 She has health issues and is not enrolled in the Academy.
 Then you want me to take charge of her
 and train her to be a practitioner of Genjutsu?
 No.
 There’s no doubt Yakumo’s latent Genjutsu powers are excellent.
 So much so that those in the clan
 put their dreams of rebuilding the family on her.
 Was there some kind of problem?
 This is just between us.
 Yes.
 Yakumo’s parents, Murakumo Kurama and his wife died, but…
 You okay? Don’t push yourself too hard.
 I’m okay. I’m fine.
 I’m just a bit out of breath.
 Listen to me, Yakumo.
 A Shinobi is not your only path.
 Huh?
 You’re a girl and you should have many other ways to live.
 I want to become a Ninja!
 I heard there’s a student named Rock Lee who can’t use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu
 striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu.
 I may not have much physical strength,
 but I could become a Ninja if I were to use that power, right?
 A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei.
 I’m not a teacher like Guy.
 Unfortunately, I cannot train you.
 All right, that’s all for today.
 Thank you very much.
 Take a bath and get a good rest.
 Right. Good-bye.
 Lee has improved again, huh?
 I heard. lt seems you’re quitting Squad 8.
 I have no choice.
 Those who develop under me end up not developing.
 It’s not like that.
 Although they’re no match for my team,
 the growth of the Genin in your team is striking.
 If that’s the case, it’s not because of my help.
 It’s the results of their own efforts.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 What do you think it is that we can do?
 As you say, Lee growing to that extent is due to his own efforts.
 All I did for him was to believe in him.
 We believe in our pupils even at the cost of our lives.
 We just need to believe in them with all our power,
 and embrace them with all our power.
 It’s not a difficult thing in the least.
 Guy, I envy you…
 I couldn’t even do something that simple.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 Believe in yourself!
 From where and how are Kurenai Sensei
 and that girl from this morning connected?
 It would seem to be worth looking into.
 That must be the Satomi Hill mountain cottage.
 Satomi Hill Cottage
 The east trap?
 So it seems.
 An intruder?
 Yes.
 Kurenai.
 Good work on your 24-hour guard. I came to visit Yakumo.
 This late at night?
 Yakumo is resting inside.
 Could you guys step away for a bit? I want to talk to her alone.
 Yes, ma’am.
 Don’t be long.
 I’ll be done in ten minutes.
 Fine.
 Nothing but creepy paintings.
 Please, Sensei!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Whoa, my heart, my heart!
 Huh? There’s nothing wrong.
 Hey, it’s you again?!
 To think you’d transform into Kurenai with a Transformation Jutsu.
 Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
 Shut up! For your sake, don’t be nosing around needlessly.
 Hey.
 You’re Yakumo. Right?
 I want to ask you something about Kurenai Sensei!
 Damn it.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Why am I sleeping in a place like this?
 It’s because you trespassed into the cottage
 under special security, remember?!
 Oh, right.
 Geez, really…
 Just be grateful you still have your life, the Anbu Black Ops are on this case.
 The Anbu Black Ops?
 That’s right, I have no time for this!
 Hey Naruto, where are you going?
 Sorry Sakura, I have to ask Kurenai Sensei about Yakumo!
 Oh, hey wait! Naruto!

 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 I guess the storm is going to come soon…
 Let’s hurry and head back to the curry shop.
 Oh my.
 That thunder right now…
 came from the direction of the Katabami Gold Mine…
 Raiga's Counterattack
 B-Boss.
 R-Ranmaru!
 Hey, wake up, Ranmaru!
 Quit joking around. I’m not laughing…
 Hey…Ranmaru…!
 You… What did you do to Ranmaru?
 N-No! He…
 When Ranmaru held your hand…
 you revived and…
 And then…Ranmaru…
 Ranmaru…
 Why is Raiga up?!
 I must stop him.
 Thunder?
 Could it be?!
 You’re slow!
 Are you…that brat’s comrade…?
 If it’s a wooden weapon, then…
 But I can’t hold it over my head…
 You’re annoying!
 You little fly…!
 Quit buzzing!
 I’m…not smart, you know…
 Huh…?
 I don’t know why this happened…
 Hey, whose fault is it? Yours?!
 N-No! That’s not true!
 Perhaps…the guys from the Leaf…
 Oh yeah… lf they didn’t come,
 then Ranmaru and I would have been together forever…
 Where are they?!
 You know, don’t you?! lf you don’t know, I’ll kill you!
 I know…
 Maybe…!
 Take me…where they are…
 Go!
 Yes!
 Hold on, Ranmaru. For your funeral…
 I’ll offer up their corpses for you.
 Ranmaru…
 This child… Did he give up his life in order to revive Raiga?
 Rai…ga… Rai…
 Ranmaru! You're alive!
 Hang in there! Ranmaru!
 Ranmaru!
 It started raining.
 But we’re almost done.
 Oh my, I’m happy that you all did this much for me.
 Oh no!
 Mom! Something horrible happened!
 Oh my… What happened, Karashi?
 Tenten is…!
 What happened to Tenten?
 She…fell from a cliff and..
 What?!
 What do you mean?!
 I was running with her and
 Tenten said that she would train me in place of Lee…
 But there…when we were approaching the Lightning Pass,
 the lightning struck and a tree came falling and
 Tenten fell from the Pass to the bottom of the cliff!
 Oh my! Then you must go help her out immediately!
 Let’s go to help, Tenten!
 Yeah!
 Umm… No, I will…
 I will come after you guys with the first-aid kit.
 Okay.
 Let’s go, Naruto, Lee.
 – Yes! 					– Right!
 Oh my, Karashi?
 Mom, we’re running away from here.
 What are you saying, child?!
 Never mind that!
 I’ll explain it later, so hurry up and get ready.
 I will wait at the Lightning Pass.
 Bring them for sure. If not…
 I’ll offer up you and your mom’s corpses to Ranmaru…
 Mom, please!
 I don’t want to!
 I'm going to wait until everybody comes back!
 Mom! You are so stubborn!
 Just come with me!
 Do you think that Tenten would fall off a cliff
 merely because of the thunder?
 Huh? What do you mean?
 That Karashi… lt seems like he wasn’t trained enough.
 I’m sorry…
 Then…
 Perhaps…it’s some kind of trap again.
 Or he’s been threatened by someone…
 But the Kurosuki Family is…!
 Maybe my eyes were cloudy…
 No way!
 It’s him…
 He’s burning up with fever…
 Raiga…?
 He revived, so you should too…
 It’s all right. I’m going to die soon anyway.
 No way! I’m not going to let you say that you're going to die so easily!
 The people who were killed by you and Raiga died against their will!
 I’m not going to let it go your way!
 For the sake of those whose freedoms you took away.
 I’m going to have you take responsibility!
 Are you okay?
 The storm… It’ll be dangerous to stay here…
 To Grandma’s place.
 You’ve come!
 Raiga!
 So he is alive.
 This time I’ll take you down for sure!
 Let’s go!
 That’s not good! Lee!
 What are you…?
 What is this?
 It’s in a whole different level from before…!
 Probably that attack was lightning made of Chakra.
 But this one…
 Real lightning is used as the source…
 If he can utilize the power of nature, unlike Chakra, he’ll have no limits!
 Get down!
 Byakugan!
 If we dodge through the electric shock and
 take this to a close-range battle…
 Naruto!
 I know it!

 Good job, Naruto!
 Gentle Fist!
 Neji!
 You brats! Is that all you know?
 Unlike the natural thunder power I’m using,
 Chakra has its limits!
 Huh…?
 You’re an idiot! There’s an idiot here!
 Is that what you say to an opponent who fought with all his power?!
 Huh?
 You again…
 This time I’m not going to have a funeral for you!
 I am angry.
 Oh my, what are you doing?!
 Please Mom, come with me!
 There’s no time.
 No, I’m going to stay here!
 Oh Tenten!
 Oh my! This stupid son of mine!
 I couldn’t help it, because the boss came back to life…
 If we stay here, we’re going to get killed.
 The only choice we have is to run away!
 If you want to run away, then go.
 I’m not running away.
 I’m not going to give up, I will save this child.
 I will feed this boy the curry of life!
 Grandma…
 It’s the curry that revived Lee.
 Yes.
 If anything happens, it’s not my fault!
 You!
 One, two…
 One, two…
 One, two… One, two…
 One, two… One, two…
 This is bad…
 This is really bad!
 Eat this…you’ll feel better.
 Please.
 You messed up on mixing the spices.
 Oh my?!
 Karashi, could you have memorized my recipe of the curry of life?
 Karashi…
 This is the true curry of life.
 Here, please eat this.
 You can’t even eat if you’re not with Raiga?
 Why…?
 Why…for a person like me?
 Does one need a reason to save someone?
 To save you,
 Grandma Sansho and Karashi did their best to make the curry.
 Don’t you feel anything seeing those two trying their best?
 If you don’t feel anything, you’re a horrible human being!
 Human beings support each other in order to live…
 If there are people who need help, don’t others naturally lend them a hand?
 Isn’t that being human?
 Anyway, one bite is fine. Why don’t you try it?
 Was it good?
 That is what it feels like to live.
 Raiga …
 I want him to eat this curry too.
 Let’s go.
 I’m far from finished…!
 This guy… What is up with him?
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Damn it! What in the world happened to my body?!
 It is pitch black in front of me, my entire body is numb,
 and my body doesn’t do what I want it to do.
 What is this feeling…?
 It’s warm, my entire body is burning,
 and what is this taste that brings energy up from the bottom of my stomach…?

 I won’t be fooled. 					You…you…

 You said you were going to deliver Gantetsu to the capital, right?
 This guy… There’s no way I’ll forgive this guy!
 What are you talking about?
 This guy…killed my family… he killed my little brother!
 Wh-What was that…?
 Gantetsu killed your family?
 Yeah.
 Five years ago.
 I’m positive that this is the guy I saw.
 Fire…!
 Oh!
 This is horrible…
 Is anybody still inside?
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio.
 Akio!
 Memory of Flames
 Akio…
 Todoroki, I found out who attacked your family.
 Really?
 A gang of bandits called the Ninja Dropouts.
 Ninja Dropouts?
 They’re ruthless… Evil personified…
 When they rob the victims of money and valuables…
 They massacre everyone in that house.
 Why?
 So as not to leave any witnesses behind.
 The bodies of your parents were found but…
 The fire spread quickly and Akio was still small so…
 Probably nothing of him remained.
 I’m sorry, but you need to let your little brother go…
 That’s impossible.
 I can't do that.
 Damn it!
 It’s ironic, isn’t it…
 When I finally find the killer of my parents and little brother…
 My mission…forces me to escort him to the capital.
 Todoroki.
 I’m a full-fledged police officer now. I’m not a spring chicken!
 I didn’t mean to bring my personal grudges onto the job…
 This guy will eventually be sentenced to death…
 That thought has allowed me to endure.
 But, right now, right in front of my eyes…
 The same face in the flame… The face that killed my little brother!
 Your…little brother?!
 Die, Gantetsu!
 –Don’t get in my way! –Stop!
 He’s a thug who’s killed countless innocent people.
 It’s your mission to deliver Gantetsu to the capital, right?!
 It doesn’t matter! He killed my little brother!
 It may be true that Gantetsu is evil, but…
 You can’t do that…
 There’s nobody watching…
 That’s right, here in the middle of this forest.
 H-Hey, Todoroki?
 Nobody’s watching… There’s no way they’ll know.
 Todoroki… I said, calm down! I’m telling you, I’m watching!
 No, nobody’s watching…
 Todoroki!
 As long as you keep your mouth shut…
 No… Better yet, if you weren’t around…
 Wait a second!
 What the heck are you thinking? Calm down!
 I'm extremely calm.
 You too must…
 It can’t be helped…
 If things come to this, I guess I have no choice but to fight!
 What’s the matter?
 Why don’t you just come right out and fight?!
 You guys, too! Why don’t you stop hiding? Come out and show yourselves!
 Huh?
 Y-You guys are…
 Stop bullying Gantetsu!
 Give Gantetsu back!
 What is this?
 I have no idea… Who the heck are they?
 Everybody!
 W-Wait a minute…
 How are you connected to Gantetsu…?
 Stop that!
 Let’s get out of here!
 Calm down.
 We should be able to understand each other
 if we just try to talk things over.
 You guys aren’t Shinobi, are you?!
 It’s dangerous for amateurs to hold blades!
 Lee, what are we gonna do?
 This is a problem…
 ‘Cause if our opponents are amateurs, we can’t go all out…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Damn it! Let go of me!
 I need to avenge the deaths of my family…and my little brother!
 Calm down!
 Calm down and think about this whole thing again!
 Your…little brother?
 Don’t be stupid, Gantetsu… Don’t come over here right now!
 Gantetsu!
 What's going on?!
 Damn it, I can’t move!
 It’s futile.
 That string is stronger than steel.
 There’s no way you’ll be able to cut through it
 with human strength alone.
 Who the heck are you?
 I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Ninja Dropout you said?
 I, Monju will take Gantetsu.
 As long as I have him, I have no more business with you guys.
 Those nets will shrink as the temperature rises.
 So you’ll suffer till the end.
 In half an hour or so…
 It will cut you into pieces.
 Farewell!
 Todoroki!
 Gantetsu!
 Damn it… I’m not about to die in a place like this.
 Our mission is to deliver Gantetsu to the capital…
 Are you an idiot ? Take a good look at this situation!
 We’ll be goners before that happens.
 I don’t believe that those Ninja Dropouts are Gantetsu’s comrades.
 Gantetsu was telling the truth. Those guys might kill Gantetsu.
 That’s why I should have killed him with my own hands!
 But remember, that guy was calling out your name to the very end!
 So what’s up with that?!
 There must be something he wanted to tell you!
 I don’t want to hear any excuses from a thug!
 I find it hard to believe that Gantetsu’s that evil a guy.
 What was that?!
 I’m telling you, I’m not about to kick the bucket
 until I’ve heard what Gantetsu wanted to say!
 Stop it!
 Hey, I’m positive we can work things out if we just talk.
 Shut up!
 Wait. 					Let’s stop this.
 I just assumed you were a Ninja Dropout, because you’re a Ninja.
 We’re Shinobi from the Leaf Village.
 We were called here to be part of the police escort
 taking Gantetsu to the capital.
 Please spare Gantetsu.
 That can’t happen.
 Gantetsu saved us from the Ninja Dropouts.
 Saved you?
 Who in the world are you guys?
 We’re all kids whose families were killed by the Ninja Dropouts.
 But Gantetsu secretly rescued us
 because he wanted to save at least the children…
 What was that?!
 Gantetsu took care of all of us kids who had become orphans…
 Gantetsu.
 Is it the Ninja Dropouts again?
 I’m sorry.
 Where am I?
 So you woke up.
 Mother…? Father…?
 Where’s Mother?
 You poor thing… But we’re all in the same boat.
 You’re not alone… We’re here for you…
 We’re your new family.
 I’m leaving the Ninja Dropouts!
 I can’t stand this any longer.
 I can’t commit robberies with those guys anymore.
 But if you don’t, they’ll kill you, Gantetsu.
 I’ll steal their money.
 Huh?
 And I’ll get myself captured by the police.
 Come on…
 If I do that,
 they’ll show up in front of the prison to try to get me back.
 That’s the only way they can be captured.
 Are you saying you’re gonna be a decoy…?
 It's so that there won’t be any more victims.
 This is my only choice.
 Gantetsu really did steal their money and was captured by the police.
 We came to this forest
 because we were worried about Gantetsu’s safety.
 We were praying that the Ninja Dropouts would get caught. However…
 So Gantetsu reformed himself
 and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right?
 We have to do something about the real evil, the Ninja Dropouts!
 I don’t really care about the Ninja Dropouts right now.
 What’s important is that we rescue Gantetsu.
 I’m guessing that Gantetsu is with Naruto.
 Don’t worry because he won’t have been captured by the Ninja Dropouts.
 Okay, let’s believe that.
 Damn…
 If things continue like this, we’ll turn into dried fish.
 Huh?
 H-Hey… It loosens up a little when sweat soaks into it.
 What?
 Are you serious?
 Oh, you’re right.
 Yeah, I know…
 What?!
 I’m used to its venom. lt’s nothing.
 I find it hard to believe that Gantetsu’s that evil a guy.
 I’m gonna meet up with Gantetsu one more time
 and find out for myself, no matter what it takes…
 That’s right… I need to see Gantetsu again, too.
 I will then avenge the deaths of my family…and of my little brother.
 We did it!
 That was a narrow escape!
 All right… Let’s hurry up and rescue Gantetsu!
 Yeah… I will find him no matter what and I'll cut him down!
 Huh?
 –Gantetsu. 					–Huh?
 That’s definitely Gantetsu.
 Those guys are…
 I-Idiot…
 –Gantetsu! 					–Gantetsu!
 Gantetsu!
 That’s as far as you’ll go, kid.
 That guy is…
 Don’t tell me he’s a Ninja Dropout?!
 Good answer.
 I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Give Gantetsu back!
 I’m not forgiving you for this!
 Hey, hey…
 Who are these little brats?
 Perhaps they’re inexperienced in the ways of the world, but…
 to tell me to give Gantetsu back…
 Give us back what we want. That’s our line, right?
 Who the heck are you guys?
 You Ninja Dropout jerks…
 We are avenging our families’ deaths!
 What?!
 You brats just stay quiet.
 Damn it!
 Stop! Monju! Let that kid go!
 It looks like you don’t quite comprehend the position you’re in right now, huh?!
 And moreover, what do they mean by avenge, huh, Gantetsu?!
 Stop!
 Ninja Art: Mesh Cage!
 It’s my turn!
 It doesn’t even budge.
 It’s useless… You won’t be able to tear through this net.
 Come on, Gantetsu, answer me.
 I refuse.
 Huh… I see.
 Then how about this?
 Akio!
 Stop it! I get it. I’ll talk, so please stop!
 You should have done that from the start.
 These children are the children from the homes
 that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked.
 I rescued them and gave them shelter.
 What? You betrayed us?
 I see… You jerk…
 You took our treasures and gave them to these guys.
 They belonged to their families in the first place.
 Don’t mess around with me… You traitor!
 Stop that!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting!
 Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
 Naruto!
 Naruto, you were safe!
 Of course I was!
 I’m not handing Gantetsu over to you no matter what!
 Gantetsu.
 That’s…
 It can’t be…!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Is that the Ninja Dropout’s hideout?
 Yes, Akio is probably in that mansion.
 Damn those Ninja Dropout bastards. I can never forgive them.
 How dare they interfere with the happy reunion of the siblings!
 This is outrageous.
 All right, let’s go, Bushy-Brows!
 I’m always okay to go. Even if the enemy is an ex-Shinobi…
 We’re going to beat them one and all,
 and definitely going to get Todoroki’s brother back!

 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Father-Son:                        The Broken Crest
 What was up… with those eyes of Big Brother’s?
 That wasn’t… just an ordinary Sharingan.
 And…quite a bit of time’s passed since then…
 but things are still kind of awkward between him and Father.
 Good morning, Father…
 Yeah, good morning.
 Sasuke… how have things been going at the Academy lately?
 It’s boring with just school classes.
 I’m always number one, so…
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 W-Wow…
 This is the fundamental Jutsu of the Uchiha.
 The Sign is as I taught you earlier.
 You build up Chakra,
 stop it once at around between the mouth and the chest area,
 and spew it out at once after that.
 Try it.
 Okay!
 Father…is teaching me Jutsu himself.
 Finally… Father has also recognized me!
 I must live up to his expectations!
 I too can…!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sure enough, it won’t go like it did with Itachi, huh?
 It might’ve still been too soon for you.
 A member of the Uchiha Clan is not recognized as full-fledged
 until they can use the Fire Style.
 The Uchiha crest…
 means those who possess the Uchiha that controls fire.
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Damn it! One more time!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Today for sure!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sasuke…!
 Wait a minute.
 What is it?
 What…?
 Oh… Don’t move.
 Okay, finished!
 Mother…
 Hmm?
 No… It’s nothing.
 Okay…
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sure enough, it won’t go like it did with Itachi, huh?
 It might’ve still been too soon for you…
 I’m just, getting started. Damn it! One more time!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Father!
 Hmm?
 One more time…
 One more time… Please join me.
 It’s still too soon for you.
 Even if I were to teach you for only after a week…
 It’s not that…
 I’ve gotten…the hang of the Jutsu.
 So I want you to see it.
 Failure is not an option!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 That’s my boy.
 You’ve done well.
 From now on, improve yourself and soar large
 so as not to bring shame to the crest on your back.
 Right!
 And…let me say one thing.
 Don’t chase after your older brother anymore.
 Mother…?
 Hmm?
 What does Father really think of Big Brother and me?
 What is it all of a sudden?
 The other day, Father said to me, “That’s my boy.”
 He’d always said that only to Big Brother.
 So I was really happy.
 I see…Good for you.
 But lately, Father and Brother haven’t been getting along, so…
 I was thinking…
 that I might just be a replacement for Big Brother.
 Your older brother’s your older brother. And you are you.
 Your father cares deeply about you both.
 Then why does he only think about Big Brother?!
 That’s not it…
 Your father has to protect the Uchiha Clan
 as a representative of the clan.
 What about it?!
 Itachi is just bigger than you and is your elder.
 He’ll naturally be entrusted
 with that much more work for the clan, right?
 Your father is the supervisor of the work, so…
 it might be that his eyes were likely to go towards your older brother.
 But, this is just between us.
 When he’s with me,
 your father does nothing but talk about you.
 He’s just always sullen and awkward, so…
 I’ll catch up to Big Brother no matter what!
 Damn it…!
 Big Brother’s back is still far out of reach.
 Forgive me, Sasuke… Maybe another time.
 Clan…Clan…
 You measure incorrectly the size of your own “vessels”
 and don’t know the depth of mine, so you grovel there.
 My “vessel” is dismayed at this foolish clan.
 I feel like…ever since that day,
 he hasn’t been the same as he was before.
 Big Brother…
 Today, when school’s finished,
 will you join me for some Shuriken Jutsu training?
 I’m busy. You should have Father teach you.
 But even I know that you’re better at Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.
 You always treat me like a nuisance like that.
 Forgive me, Sasuke. Maybe next time…
 I don’t have the time to be dealing with you today.
 You always say, “Forgive me, Sasuke,” and poke me on the forehead.
 and you say “today,” but it never happens.
 Thank goodness… he’s the same as before.
 Big Brother…
 His eyes looking back at Father that time…
 It wasn’t just an ordinary Sharingan…
 And…
 Father…?
 Hmm?
 Are there several types of Sharingan?
 Oh…You’re already interested in Sharingan?
 However, it's still too soon for you.
 It’s totally different from the Fire Style Jutsu.
 But someday, I too…!
 After all… I’m your kid, so.
 Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu above the Sharingan,
 the Mangekyo Sharingan.
 Mangekyo Sharingan…
 In the long history of the Uchiha,
 it’s a legendary Visual Jutsu that only a few develop.
 And it’s said that it only opened under a particular condition.
 A particular condition…?
 Don’t chase after your older brother anymore.
 I wonder what he thinks of my relationship with Brother?
 Father…
 Why doesn’t Big Brother care about me?
 He’s a bit peculiar…
 He’s a type of person who doesn’t care for making friends with people.
 Why?
 Who knows…?
 Even I, his father, can’t read that boy.
 Here I spoke because I wanted more of Big Brother’s attention.
 Father isn’t against it.
 Here, Sasuke! Your box lunch.
 I’ll watch your Shuriken practice after you come home.
 It’s not practice, it’s training!
 I’m off!
 That’s good…
 It’s not that Father dislikes Big Brother, after all.
 Big Brother graduated from the Academy at the top of his class at age seven.
 He learned to use the Sharingan at age eight.
 And he was promoted to Chunin at age ten.
 But, I’ve got the same Uchiha blood flowing inside me as he does.
 I won’t lose to him!
 You’re not gonna tell me this is the best you can do, are you?
 You boast about your Way of Ninja and this is all you've got?
 Are you still thinking that I’m a member of your comrade game?
 If that’s the case, you're…
 a hopeless fool!
 Stop wasting time!
 Give me all you’ve got,
 you number one hyperactive, knucklehead Ninja!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Just as Neji said,
 it seems Sasuke’s in the darkness right now.
 Damn it.
 He really did hit me with all his might.
 Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade or anything anymore?!
 Don’t all those things we did together in Squad Seven
 mean anything to you?!

 That darn Naruto…
 Zero Motivation: The Guy with Cloud Envy!
 – C’mon! – Hurry up with the match!
 Finish it up already!
 Stand up and start the match!
 Evidently, people don’t want to see the minor players’ matches
 since they were really looking forward to Sasuke’s match…
 If people aren't expecting anything exciting from this battle,
 makes no sense for me to have it.
 What? You’re giving up, too?
 My opponent’s a girl again?
 Hey, why aren’t you moving?!
 C'mon, get started!
 That kid has had zero fighting spirit from the beginning…
 C’mon! What is he doing?!
 C’mon Shikamaru! Get it together and do it!
 If you don’t come, I’ll go!
 Hey! Haven’t started yet…
 Man, that girl is so gung-ho.
 It doesn’t really matter if I become a Chunin or not.
 But there's no reason why a man should lose to a woman.
 Well… let’s do it!
 This guy’s quick to run away…
 Nor any reason why a man should rough up a woman.
 But I don’t want to be roughed up either.
 He’s the kind of Ninja that uses shadows.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 He’s probably trying to lure me into the trees where there're lots of shadows…
 but I won’t let him.
 Why am I the only one who always gets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!
 Shikamaru! You get her with a torrent of 16 combination…!
 Mind if I sit here?
 Huh?
 What…you? Your stomach okay?
 What? Wasn’t Sasuke’s match next?
 Shh!
 Everything’s fine, right, Sakura? After all, it's Sasuke, right?
 R-Right now, I should leave her alone.
 It looks like Shikamaru taking part in this final battle,
 it seems like he's in the wrong place.
 Don’t say that!
 I certainly don’t think that he has any great techniques,
 but that Shikamaru is always good at strategizing.
 That’s why I feel like we ended up in the preliminary round the other day.
 Hmm, yeah well…
 And after all, he jumped down into the arena himself.
 He seems uncharacteristically driven.
 Even he can be passionate once in a while!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 Geez, I envy a cloud being so free…
 I guess I pretty much am completely without desire…
 Even the reason why I became a Ninja…
 was because I thought I would have a fun life, ya know…
 Get it together!
 C’mon Shikamaru!
 But…of course, it’s not that easy.
 What’s going on with that stupid face?! ls he underestimating me?
 Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
 That’s right, with this attack, my armed attacks also were beaten down.
 I see…
 Shadow Possession Jutsu! I’ve seen that true identity!
 Evidently there’s a limit to the stretching and shortening,
 changing shape of the shadow…
 No matter how much you change the shape of the shadow,
 even when you stretch it,
 it can only span up to the size of your own shadow.
 That’s right isn’t it?
 You got it…
 Even if I assume that he's made up the distance,
 by stretching his shadow from the edge of the shadow of the arena wall…
 This is the limit to how far the shadow can stretch.
 This is the scope of his attack!
 15 meters, 32 centimeters!
 She took the distance with the folding fan.
 Temari is stronger at long distance battles than she is at close range…
 the outcome has already been decided.
 What? What is that sign…?
 That’s no sign. That’s like, his habit.
 Habit…?
 He enjoys passing time slowly. That guy’s like an old man.
 That’s why he likes Japanese checkers and chess
 and always makes me be his opponent.
 When he’s stuck on a move, he always does that.
 Why?
 He’s working out his strategy.
 And, I’ve never beaten him.
 A strategy… but this is an actual fight.
 It’s different from a game.
 But it's said that formation pieces that were used to build battle strategy
 eventually become game pieces.
 Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.
 Wait a minute.
 When we grouped the Genin, I saw his scores.
 They were at about the same level of that Naruto’s.
 He said that moving his pencil during written exams at the academy is a pain,
 and during the tests, he always sleeps instead.
 A pain…?
 He was so good at strategy games, I felt something wasn’t right…
 so I had him take an IQ test under the pretense that it was a game.
 And… how did it turn out?... …
 He was more than brilliant.
 With an IQ of over 200, he’s a super genius!
 T-Two hundred?!
 He’s done thinking… lt starts now.
 Looks like you’ve got some fighting spirit now…
 It’s pointless to hide!
 I wonder if he’s really got a strategy…
 M-Maybe…
 With that he has no approach!
 Shikamaru! Go for it!
 It’s pointless, isn’t it?
 He’ll give up soon.
 He hates things that are a pain in the butt.
 You're wrong! At least, I hope so…
 But you may be right…
 How long are you going to run away! Cut it out!
 It’s no use.
 As long as I’m on the outside of this line,
 he absolutely can’t catch me…
 No, wait! Close call!
 You caught on well.
 So you were dragging your feet to wait for the sun to set…
 in order to make the surface of your own shadow larger
 by stretching the shadow line of the wall.
 As the sun goes down, the shadows lengthen.
 Isn't that so?
 That was close! Shikamaru…
 But why is he using shadows?
 After all, Shikamaru is inside the shadow of the field.
 If there’s even a little bit of light, he can make a shadow within a shadow!
 You don’t know a thing about Shikamaru!
 A shadow…in a shadow…?
 Even if I calculate the height of the sun now
 and the limit to the distance of the previous attack,
 there's no mistaking the distance!
 Temari! Up!
 I see.
 What’s this?!
 Darn it!
 I won’t let you escape!
 I didn’t expect that he would create extra shadows to reach me
 by making a parachute with his jacket…!
 He’s impressive.
 Once I notice the parachute from above, I’ll take my attention off from my feet.
 That’s a sneaky trick to catch me off my guard!
 However, now it’s clear.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu is
 one in which other shadows are used to get your opponent,
 a skillful technique!
 She’s dodged this trick too…
 Not careful enough in the final stage.
 And his opponent is fairly analytical.
 She’s good at thinking ahead.
 If this battle takes too long,
 the shadows in the arena will grow, and his territory will increase.
 I’ll defeat him with the next one!
 Should I make a diversion with Clone Jutsu…?
 Now his shadow is…
 Okay!
 Clone…
 N-No way…!
 My... body is…?!
 At last… Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
 What?!
 What’s going on…?
 That boy…
 How much is he planning ahead…?
 That’s Shikamaru’s skill.
 Why…won’t my body move?!
 The shadow shouldn’t have reached this far.
 I'll let you take a look behind you…
 T-This hole…!
 You saw it too, didn’t you…?
 That hole is the hole Naruto burrowed and flew out of.
 So it’s connected to the big hole in front of you.
 I didn’t expect that… a shadow in a tunnel of a hole…
 Right.
 Pure and simple, a calculated chess move.
 So his purpose to make Temari measure the limit of the shadow several times
 was to lead her to his final trick of using this hole.
 Temari battled on the outside of the limit of the shadow
 that she measured and followed,
 but he caught her from behind, trailed by the shadow she couldn’t see…
 There is no escape from this.
 I-It can’t be…
 The attack that he used with the jacket,
 was it a device to lead me to right this spot…?
 Was that an underplot too?!
 Why that--?!
 Checkmate with the next one.
 My body is moving on its own! I can’t resist it!
 Before anyone knew it, they fell under the spell of this match.
 That guy with no mark is quite a darkhorse.
 Yes! You did it!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 Check…
 Good grief… I give up!
 What?!
 See I told you…he’d give up.
 Ino doesn’t know anything about Shikamaru.
 W-What did you say?!
 I’ve used too much Chakra from Shadow Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.
 I can’t hold it another 10 seconds.
 I thought of the next trick 200 times.
 But I’m out of time…
 This has become such a pain.
 Doing one match is good…
 That guy is a strange one.
 The winner is Temari!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!

 Wow, this is the largest cheer from the audience ever!
 Of course. The featured battle of this final tournament is about to begin.
 Hate to admit it, but I'm looking forward to it myself.
 Hey, Shikamaru. I can't hear what you said.
 There's not a single person who's not excited about the featured battle.

 This is namely the secret of “the one that guides…”
 What’s that?
 It probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means we’re supposed to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, I’m going to open it.
 Huh? What’s this?
 A man…?
 A person…?
 This is…a Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto! Sakura! Let go of the scroll!
 Oh...
 Wha--?!
 Y-You…
 Hi!
 It’s been a long time.
 Surviving the Cut! The Rookie Nine Together Again!
 W-What’s going on?
 It appears you guys have had a rough time of it.
 What?!
 Why are you appearing with a Summoning?
 At the end of this second exam,
 we Chunin are to welcome the test-takers.
 I just happened to be given
 the important task of being the messenger for you guys.
 Messenger…?!
 Just in time.
 Everyone…
 Congratulations on surviving the second exam.
 To celebrate your passing,
 I’d like to treat you to some Ichiraku ramen, but…
 Ohh... Cool!
 Uh-oh…
 H-Hey, Naruto!
 – Listen to the end… – Cool! Cool!
 Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it!
 I’ve done great job! I’m the greatest!
 I so want to eat ramen! Believe it!
 He’s got so much energy.
 Yaaaay!
 Shut up!
 Man, that scatterbrained part of you is the same as always, eh.
 I see.
 Huh?
 If we had looked at the scroll in the middle of the exam,
 what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?
 Sasuke, you’re a sharp one, as usual.
 You guessed right.
 The rules of this exam were to test your conclusive mission execution ability.
 To put it simply,
 in the case of the scrolls being opened contrary to the rules…
 In the case of them being opened…?
 I was ordered to knock unconscious the test-takers in front of me
 until the end of the exam.
 Good thing you didn’t open the scroll.
 Kabuto, thank you!
 Phew!
 That was seriously close…
 Oh yeah, Sensei!
 Huh?
 By the way, what’re the letters on that wall?
 They’re kind of vermiculated and
 we don’t understand their meaning at all.
 Never mind, never mind!
 We passed!
 No…explaining that is one more of my duties.
 What, really?
 I’m saying that’s right.
 Give it a read.
 These are Chunin instructions Master Hokage recorded.
 Instructions?!
 That’s right!
 Heaven in this text refers to the human head.
 Earth refers to the human body.
 No kidding…
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 In other words…
 If your weaknesses are inside your head, Naruto…
 learn various logics in preparing for your missions.
 Hah! So meddlesome!
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run through the fields in search of an advantage.
 If your weaknesses are in your physical strength, Sakura,
 it means you must not slack off on your daily training.
 And if you combine both Heaven and Earth…
 Any perilous mission is the right way…
 In other words…
 what can also be called a rule of might and become a safe mission.
 Then, what about the spot with the missing letter?
 The letter refers to Chunin.
 The one letter for “person” that was in the scroll from earlier goes there.
 These five days of survival were to test
 the test-takers’ fundamental abilities as Chunin.
 And you guys cleared it in fine style.
 Chunin is of unit-leader class.
 They have the responsibility of leading a team.
 Be more deeply aware of the necessity of physical strength…
 and knowledge in missions!
 I want you to take on the next step,
 never forgetting these Chunin instructions.
 That is all of the messenger task I was given.
 Got it!
 Huh?
 But, as for the final third exam, don’t push it too far.
 Especially you, Naruto.
 – You’re the biggest worry… – Iruka Sensei.
 From when I received the Leaf headband,
 I was no longer an Academy student, you know?!
 There’s nothing to worry! Believe it!
 Also, this is the proof you gave me that I’m full-fledged, right?!
 That I’m scatterbrained may not have changed,
 but I’m not a kid anymore!
 I'm now...
 A Ninja!
 I see.
 I’m sorry, Naruto.
 I know their strength the best.
 If it’s futile anyway,
 I would like to give them the final word personally.
 If you’re that hung up on it, I can leave that team to you.
 To think you’d play the devil’s advocate…
 Thank you very much.
 But, they’re Kakashi’s, right?
 If he’s the one who recommended them,
 I thought I could count on them.
 Stay out of it!
 They’re not your students anymore. They’re my subordinates now.
 The one who might truly understand
 the strength of these kids. might be you, Kakashi.
 How is it?
 Does the Curse Mark still hurt?
 No.
 Thanks to you, it’s gotten quite a bit better.
 Anyway, Orochimaru is one of those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?
 He’s a S-rank bingo book rouge Shinobi
 who even the Anbu couldn’t touch, right?
 I heard that he’d already died, but…
 Why’d he come to this village now…?
 There’s a kid I want, you see.
 This kid inherits the abilities of the Uchiha clan, so…
 It's...
 It’s probably Sasuke, right?
 Huh?!
 Master Anko!
 Twenty-one second exam finishers have been confirmed.
 As for the third exam, according to the regulations of the Chunin Exams,
 preliminaries are planned for the first time in five years.
 The second exam is over.
 For the time being, continue the exams as is,
 but while keeping an eye on his movements.
 Yes…
 First off, congratulations on finishing the second exam.
 There were seventy-eight test-takers for the second exam.
 To think twenty-one have made it this far.
 I said to make it less than half, but I’d really thought about single digits.
 I’m hungry!
 There are still this many remaining?
 This is such a major pain.
 Sasuke and others have passed, too.
 Of course…
 We went to that much trouble to save them…
 It’d all be for naught if they didn’t pass.
 Your team didn’t do too bad.
 I guess they were lucky.
 But as long as my team is around, they can’t go any higher.
 After all, whether you like it or not,
 ability talks at the next barrier.
 Well, adolescence can sometimes be bittersweet and
 can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi…
 Did you say something?
 Oh my God!
 Not bad, my rival Kakashi.
 But that part of you is so hip... which is what annoys me!
 So that’s Guy Sensei’s eternal rival, eh?
 Guy Sensei totally loses visually…
 Guy Sensei is the hippest of all the teachers!
 He shines!
 Okay!
 Please watch, Guy Sensei! I’ll shine, too!
 I don’t ever want to see tears of those dear to me again.
 So…
 I won’t ever lose again!
 Guy Sensei.
 Sure enough, the outstanding candidates have gathered.
 Sasuke Uchiha, eh?
 I’ll get you back for my arms, Sasuke Uchiha…
 At any cost.
 To think a mere seven teams are left of the twenty-six…
 Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.
 Akamaru’s acting strange…
 Those Sand Village guys…
 Naruto passed, too.
 Thank goodness…
 What, all the Leaf Village rookies are here.
 Say! Say!
 Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and even Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!
 It feels like everyone’s assembled.
 Humph…I don’t have a very good feeling.
 To think this many are left…
 Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies…
 So that’s why they fought  in recommending them.
 Now then, we will now have the explanation of the third exam
 from Master Hokage.
 Listen carefully, everybody!
 Now then, if you will, Master Hokage.
 All right.
 Before the explanation of the third exam that we will start from now,
 I have just one thing I want to tell everyone flat out.
 About the true purpose of these exams.
 True purpose…?!
 Why do allied nations conduct the exams on a conjoint basis?
 Huh?
 Raising the levels of the shinobi and friendship among allied nations.
 It won’t do to have the wrong idea of the true meaning of that statement.
 These exams are so to speak…
 So to speak…?
 A microcosm of battle between allied nations.
 What does that mean?
 If we look back on history,
 the allied nations of today were once neighboring nations
 that continued to vie with each other and battle for power.
 In order to avoid a futile crushing of each others’ military strength,
 those nations mutually selected a place to battle.
 And that was how the Chunin Exams originally began.
 W-Why do we have to do such a thing?
 We’re not doing this to select Chunins?!
 There is no question that these exams are to select Shinobi
 worthy of becoming Chunin.
 But on the other hand,
 these exams also provide a venue
 for Shinobi who carry their nation’s pride on their backs to fight for their lives!
 Nation’s pride…?
 Many feudal lords and those of prominence from many nations
 who request Shinobi for work are invited to this third exam as guests.
 And, the feudal lords and Head Ninja of each Village
 of the nations will watch your battles.
 If the gap in national power becomes unbridgeable,
 the strong nations are inundated with job requests.
 The requests of nations deemed weak, on the other hand, decline.
 And therewithal,
 we can exert pressure upon each neighboring nation...
 That is to say, just how much military strength our Village is developing and has.
 Even so, why is it necessary for us to fight for our lives?!
 The nation’s strength is the Village’s strength.
 The Village’s strength is the Shinobi’s strength.
 And the true strength of the Shinobi is created only in a fight for one’s life!
 This exam is a place to see the strength of home country Shinobi,
 and a place to display this as well.
 It is because it’s an exam where you truly fight for your life
 that this has meaning.
 It’s for this very reason that your forerunners fought in this exam,
 a dream worth striving for.
 Then why… use the expression “friendship”?!
 I said it at the start, didn’t I?!
 That it won’t do for you to have the wrong idea of the meaning!
 It’s a custom where balance is preserved by fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendship of the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life with the pride of the village and
 one’s own dream on the line.
 Heh, I’m convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the content of that fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where I’d like to explain the third exam.
 But actually…
 Master Hokage, please allow me, Hayate Gekko,
 who was given the task of judge,  to speak first.
 I leave it to you…
 Nice to meet you, everyone…
 Umm, there’s something… I'd like you all to do...
 before the third exam.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's the idea? Sudden preliminaries?
 Didn't we just get to the tower? Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.
 It's too much for you, Sasuke! Please, drop out!
 You're in no condition to fight properly!
 No matter what you say,
 I'm going to tell the teachers about that bruise.
 Next episode: ""Narrowing the Field: Sudden Death Elimination!""
 Sasuke, I'm scared.

 Hey, Pervy Sage. What Jutsu are you gonna teach me this time?
 The last time was Walk-on-Water Jutsu, so is it gonna be Walk-on-Fire Jutsu?
 Or maybe Walk-in-the-Air?
 Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!
 You keep calling me Pervy Sage.
 So you have no idea that I’m a superb person, huh?
 Huh…? A superb Pervy Sage?
 Nhaagh… Listen carefully!
 Toad Sage is only a disguise!
 As a matter of fact…!
 North and South and East and West!
 I’m the white-maned toad charmer,
 and one of the legendary Sannin whom even celestial beings can’t defeat.
 Such a stud!
 That he strikes fear… in the hearts of people!
 I am no other than “Master Jiraiya”!
 Yes… 					I’m talking about me!
 Huh…
 Jiraiya: Naruto's Potential Disaster
 Atafuku Town? That’s ten kilometers from here!
 It’s “O”tafuku Town!
 Hey…hey… 					Hey, Pervy Sage!
 I’m telling you, it’s Jiraiya. Gimme a break…
 So the fact that such a bigwig Pervy Sage like you
 is taking me along as his travel companion means…
 that I’m potentially a genius?
 Just as I thought!
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Why did you choose me?
 A long time ago, the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.
 And you resemble the Fourth Hokage so much, it’s almost funny.
 That’s the only reason…
 I…?
 The Fourth Hokage…?
 Yeah!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 W-What is it?
 Yeah!
 The fact that I resemble the Fourth Hokage means
 that I also possess genius of his level, right?
 I’ll become the Hokage, after all! All right!
 W-Wait…
 I stepped on some dog poop!
 About the only areas you resemble the Fourth Hokage
 are your hair and your stubbornness!
 What was that?! You senile Pervy Sage!
 Not again!
 Sakura? Come here!
 Okay!
 Please take these rice sweets over to Ino’s house.
 Ino’s house?
 These?
 That’s right…
 Don’t bother them by staying too long.
 Because everyone is very busy at this time.
 I know that!
 See you later!
 Oh, yeah…
 I’ll bring some over to Sasuke later on too.
 I wonder if he likes sweets…?
 And to Naruto too…
 Naruto looks like he would eat anything…
 Hey Kakashi Sensei! Teach me Chidori too!
 You may say teach me, but it’s not that easy.
 What the heck’s that?!
 That’s not fair, show me how! Teach it to me.
 Sasuke… Thank you…
 You rescued me from the Sand Ninja, right?
 No…
 Huh?
 For a start, why don’t you try gathering Chakra in your palms!
 All right!
 The person who rescued you… was Naruto.
 Like this? Like this?
 Oh come on, Sasuke, you’re being overmodest again.
 It’s true that Naruto has gotten stronger, but against that Sand Ninja…
 I’m telling you the truth.
 That kid fought desperately to rescue you.
 He showed a kind of strength that he had never shown before.
 Naruto rescued…me.
 Oh, it’s coming…
 Chidori! Huh? Chidori! Chidori!
 All right! I’ll bring some to Naruto too!
 I wasn’t… I wasn’t able to do anything…
 I don’t want to watch a precious comrade die right before my eyes ever again…
 No matter what, I will protect you!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.
 Compared to him, I…
 While you may able to manage against him,
 I couldn’t possibly…
 He’s in a completely different level…
 Yeah…
 If we go at each other, we’ll either both be killed or at best,
 kill each other simultaneously.
 Even if we increased the numbers, that wouldn’t change.
 I didn’t expect the kid’s guard would be a legendary Sannin.
 With him as the opponent…
 the names of Leaf Village’s Uchiha Clan
 and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of Mist would be tarnished.
 Yeah. However…
 Any strong one has a weakness…
 Stop! You will get cursed!
 Hey, hey, Pervy Sage…
 Huh?!
 What kind of a student was the Fourth Hokage?
 Well, I guess one could say
 that he developed to that extent because he was my student…
 You’re one lucky guy to be taught by me!
 – Hmmm… 					– Hmmm…
 Are you dubious?
 A good teacher will develop good disciples.
 That goes without saying.
 Then, then, who taught you, Pervy Sage?
 Me?
 I learned from the Third Hokage.
 The Third Hokage?
 That’s right…
 The Third Hokage was still young and lively.
 – The Third Hokage…young and lively? – The Third Hokage…young and lively?
 That’s right! I was young and lively too!
 Young and lively?!
 I…I got tangled up.
 See… You got cursed…
 So you learned from Kakashi.
 Then you experienced the “Bell Training,” right?
 Huh…?
 Yeah! I did! Yes I did!
 Only I was tied to the tree trunk and had one deuce of a time…
 What? You too?
 Huh? What do you mean by “you too”?
 Huh?
 What do you mean by “you too”?
 Why don’t you just hurry, get up and return those things.
 Even if you were to say that… it’s pretty difficult…
 There are two bells.
 The fact that there are only two means…
 That one of us has to go to the tree trunk…
 You’re quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.
 All right! I’ll make it!
 Come at me with the intent to kill!
 Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn’t I?
 You got tied to the tree trunk, after all.
 Shut up!
 You flat-chested like a cutting board.
 What did you say?! You nerdy perv!
 Okay, Okay, that’s enough.
 Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!
 Okay!
 You are hopeless…
 Ninja shouldn’t be getting caught in obvious traps like that over and over again.
 But…
 Why don’t you learn a little from Orochimaru?!
 Sarutobi Sensei, you’re always saying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!
 Hm?
 When it comes to snooping, I’m really good at Transparency Jutsu.
 Gimme a break…
 I don’t even wanna know
 what level of Transparency Jutsu you possess…
 I’ve never been caught once! And that’s the truth!
 If you’re that sure of yourself, I’ll go with you next time…
 You’re such a lecher, Sarutobi Sensei…
 Huh?! Huh?
 What, what?
 Hey!
 What’s so funny?! Pervy Sage!
 Huh?
 It’s just as I said, a good teacher will develop good disciples.
 Huh…? I don’t understand what you’re saying!
 Come on, let’s go. Did you put it back properly?
 Yeah, I fixed them!
 See!
 It appears that they haven’t found Naruto yet.
 But don’t you think that’s strange?
 Those guys had already infiltrated the village.
 It should be easy to find Naruto in this village.
 Itachi knows Naruto’s face.
 Kakashi…
 Why is Kakashi sleeping?
 Besides, only Jonin are gathering here…
 What are you doing? What in the world happened?!
 Nothing…in particular…
 Is it true that that ltachi has returned?!
 And moreover, that he’s after Naruto…?!
 Oh…
 Idiot…
 Why does this always happen?!
 So that guy returned to this village? And moreover, he’s pursuing Naruto?
 What does all this mean?!
 Sasuke?!
 Where’s Naruto?!
 Huh? I just got here too.
 I wanted to give Naruto…
 Some sweets…?
 If Naruto is caught by that guy, that will spell his end.
 I’m not gonna let him do that!
 Hey old man! Naruto must have come here!
 And do you know where he went after that?
 Oh, Naruto, right…
 If I remember correctly…
 Master Jiraiya came here around noon and…
 They ate ramen together, and he said he was going somewhere…
 Where?!
 Hmm…I think he said to a post station some distance from the village…
 And then he left with Master Jiraiya.
 Jiraiya?
 Jiraiya – one of the genius Sannin.
 Well, in appearance,
 he just looks like a big white-haired old man.
 Big and white-haired…
 H-Hey!
 Geez… If you’re gonna ask somebody a question,
 it’s only polite to stay and have a ramen or something.
 Candies are here.
 This town is pretty weird.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 We’re staying here tonight!
 What?! I can still walk!
 A disciple should obey his master!
 I just want to learn the Jutsu!
 That’s what’s called a disciple!
 Huh?!
 Oh, oh…!
 Naruto!
 Yes?
 Here, this is the key to the room.
 Go to the room ahead of me, practice Chakra,
 train some and go to sleep!
 Got it?!
 What?!
 “The adult world is gonna begin from this point on”…
 Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?! That’s not fair!
 That post town isn’t that far…!
 This! Somehow this always happens when I’m with that Pervy Sage!
 Darn…
 Here…
 Candies are here!
 I’ve got to check door by door!
 Cheers!
 I wonder if he really has any inclination to oversee my training?
 What about that one? Yeah that.
 See! A hundred out of a hundred!
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 This is an inn for women only…
 I’m looking for someone…
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 Today, we only have old people.
 Hmm…this is kind of crisp on the tongue…
 Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 White-haired…?
 Are they here?!
 Eh…Do I remember seeing some people like that earlier
 when shifts changed…?
 This tastes bitter… are you all right with it? Cheers!
 Oh! A blond kid and a white-haired old man!
 They’re here?! What’s their room number!
 Um…
 Room number one at the end of the hallway
 on the second floor…
 What’s up? Has she already dumped you?
 Okay, Okay!
 Okay, Okay, I’ll open up!
 Naruto!
 It’s not him…
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Darn it! My body is frozen! What is this creepy feeling?
 This guy is absolutely not an ordinary person.
 He’s got the same Sharingan as Sasuke.
 He’s a member of Uchiha clan.
 Is this the guy Sasuke was talking about?
 Next time: “Roar, Chidori! Brother vs. Brother!”

 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering

 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows

 Don't!
 This is a teleportation Jutsu that
 uses mirrors that can reflect only my image.
 Watching you from the speed I move,
 it almost seems as if you aren't moving at all…
 I knew it!
 Is that Jutsu… the Kekkei Genkai?!
 Kekkei…Genkai…?
 It's the same type as my Sharingan…
 Then…!
 That's right…
 It's impossible even for me to copy that Jutsu…
 And there's no way to destroy that Jutsu, either!

 The dream to have my strength recognized by everyone in the village…
 and become the Hokage!
 Dream…
 I, for the sake of my dream. And you, for the sake of your dream.
 Please don't hold it against me.
 I want to protect someone special to me…
 I work for the sake of that person, I fight for that person,

 Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters
 Sasuke! Naruto! Don't lose to a guy like that!
 Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!
 What?
 Even if there was a chance that we could break that technique,
 they won't be able to defeat that boy.
 W-What do you mean?
 They don't have the mentality to kill their feelings…
 and kill another person!
 That boy really knows the agony of being a Shinobi.
 He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.
 Exactly…
 No real Shinobi will come out of a peace-addicted village like yours.
 Because they are not able to learn
 the most important ""experience of killing""!
 Then…
 Then…
 What are we going to do, Sensei?!
 If I go over to Naruto and Sasuke,
 Tazuna will be in danger.
 Even if I try the Shadow Clones.
 He'll come to stop me with his Water Clones.
 I'll just be wasting Chakra.
 Then...
 I'm sorry but...
 I'm going to have to finish this in an instant.
 Sharingan?!
 The Sharingan again?
 Such an unimaginative guy!
 Sensei!
 You might call me ""an unimaginative guy,""
 but you are afraid of the Sharingan, after all... Zabuza!
 The secret technique of a Shinobi…
 isn't something that you show your opponent so many times.
 Be appreciative.
 You're the only who has had the chance to see it twice…
 And there will be no third time…
 Even if you were able to defeat me, you can't defeat Haku…
 What…?
 Kakashi Sensei can't win?
 That boy in the mask is that strong?
 Since he was a kid, I have been painstakingly teaching him
 the battle techniques of the Ninja!
 All of my techniques.
 On top of that…
 he has been polishing up his own skills as well!
 As a result...
 He has...
 no matter how unbelievably difficult his predicament,
 been extremely successful.
 He has no ""heart"" and has abandoned the notion of ""life.""
 He is a fighting machine known as a Shinobi.
 Not only that, his Jutsu surpasses mine!
 The terrifying ability of the Kekkei Genkai.
 In other words, I have acquired a sophisticated tool.
 Unlike the scrap you're carrying around.
 I'm not one to be afraid just because I failed once!
 I'll do it as many times as it takes!
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Stop!
 W-What the hell is it…?!
 I-It was just slight but…
 I could see the trails of his movements…
 One more try!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't you understand that it's useless?
 Just because I see the trail,
 doesn't mean that I can keep up with his speed.
 The water… is being repelled.
 But, what if that wasn't water…?
 All right…
 The next one is going to be my one shot!
 Just because a bunch of scrap got together
 doesn't mean that they can defeat Haku.
 He is…. He is the best tool!
 There's nothing boring than a stranger bragging…
 It's about time… I make my move.
 Now wait. As long as we're talking…
 Let me brag about another thing…
 Hmm?
 In the battle before,
 I didn't just let you defeat me like a fool.
 It's over…
 Haku, who was hiding in the corner,
 was observing part of the battle.
 Haku is quite smart.
 With his ability to analyze,
 he is able to plan a counterattack after observing a technique just once.
 I've been anxious to copy your line.

 That's right.
 I have to trust Sasuke, Naruto and Kakashi Sensei right now…
 And I should do what I can do!
 Huh?
 Oh! Sakura!
 Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,  don't move away from me!
 Yeah… I soo know it!
 I know… 					Zabuza…
 I'll finish them off soon enough…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You just don't learn, do you?!
 What? The Fire Style Jutsu!
 It takes…too long!
 This is good!
 Bit by bit, I'm figuring out the timing...
 I know it's called Hidden Mist, but the fog is way too thick…
 Even Zabuza himself shouldn't be able to see anything...
 Good job on dodging it…
 Just what I expect of Kakashi of the Sharingan...
 He's….
 closing his eyes!
 But…the next time you see me,
 that'll be the end of it all…
 You overrate the Sharingan too much.
 What…?
 You spoke as if you saw through everything, but…
 Why?
 Could it be possible that you can see the future…?!
 You are going to die.
 Your foresight was wrong, after all.
 Kakashi...
 You can't read my mind or my future...
 The Sharingan is merely a diversion that makes you believe that!
 Those who have the Sharingan...
 possess both perceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes…
 Using these two powers and bringing out Jutsus one after the other..
 you were just acting as if you can read the future!
 First with the perceptive eyes, you copied my movement right away.
 And this is the Image Replication Method.
 You first got me in a ruffle with it…
 Once you make sure that I'm flustered,
 you nail the ""heart's voice.""
 – This is the Mind Imitation Method. – It's only an imitation, after all.
 – You can't defeat me! You monkey! – You can't defeat me! You monkey!
 That imitating monkey mouth...
 I'll make sure that you won't be able to open it any more!
 And…
 You judged the right timing when my frustration was reaching its height
 W-What is that?
 You set a clever trap.
 Me...?
 You used the Genjutsu with your hypnotic eye and
 made me weave the signs first...
 This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...
 The Giant Vortex Jutsu!
 R-Ridiculous!
 Then that makes it easier.
 First vanish into the thick fog,
 and make your perceptive eyes useless….
 Huh?
 Darn! The guard is falling behind!
 I will close my eyes as well!
 I will shut off your ability to use your hypnotic eye
 in a close-distance battle.
 Why?
 That also means that you will lose your ability to see.
 Did you forget...?
 That I am a genius in Silent Killing,
 a technique to find the target just by sound.
 He read my movement... No way could he do that.
 Darn! We were so close!
 Naruto, can you still move?
 Of course! I'm totally fine!
 He's pretty much spent… and it's no wonder.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 But thanks to him, I found our way out.
 I found the way to break through!
 Hah!  Impossible!
 That was just a coincidence.
 Naruto! Run!
 What?
 Run out of here and attack from the outside!
 A-All right!
 You won't be able to...!
 I-I'm not going to lose!
 There!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Darn!
 T-That was good just now!
 What?
 We're doing it one more time!
 All right!
 It's likely that there's a limit to that guy's Chakra, too!
 To prove that, he's little by little…
 This won't go as you've planned.
 First, I'll get you!
 Sasuke!
 Darn! It's been a while since I've fought in such bad conditions.
 And I'm worried about Sasuke and Naruto, too...
 Be calm… Think... What will he come after?
 Oh no!
 What?!
 Too late!
 Why? Why is it?
 Why did this happen?
 I never asked for your help! I hated you!
 But you…
 Darn! I won't forgive you!

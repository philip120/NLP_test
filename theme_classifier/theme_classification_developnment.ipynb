Shadow clones?!\\n If so… Kagero!\\n Understood…\\n Come out!\\n Borne to be born, lived to live, one sunrise and one sunset…\\n The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.\\n Thinking that such a fleeting life is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable…\\n Know that I’m at my best\\n when living in the dark and deep in the ground!\\n Ninja Art:\\n Ant Lion Jutsu!\\n When I recalled the parts one by one,\\n I felt as though I had understood everything\\n Faded words which I kept so close to me\\n Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,\\n and this distant yearning for you\\n I live, simply repeating this cycle\\n Held in my two hands A droplet of time\\n Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words\\n I’ll keep these thoughts…\\n Darn it! What a pesky bunch!\\n But I won’t be done in so easily!\\n I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk’s butt\\n and bring back Sasuke and Sasame’s cousin!\\n It doesn’t matter if you guys are powerhouses!\\n I’ll kick all of your butts, so bring it on from anywhere!\\n Next episode, “Pure Betrayal, and a Fleeting Plea!”\\n\""

Losing was expected…\\n And the Shinobi clans of this land\\n who participated in the losing battle went to ruin…\\n We the Fuma Clan as well. I hear that among the surviving Shinobi,\\n there are those who have left the land\\n and those who have stooped to become thieves. Even so, we’ve lived believing in a restoration of the clan\\n and continued to live hiding in the shadows.',\n",
       " 'At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden in the Sound appeared before us\\n attempting to create the first full-scale Shinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies. The emissary of the Sound Village said…\\n My master Orochimaru is gathering all sorts of Jutsu! He has taken an interest in your Jutsu well. Depending on your work,\\n you might be given the chance to serve the Feudal Lord! My cousin Arashi…\\n was an up-and-coming star for the restoration of the clan…\\n Arashi as a representative of the clan\\n headed for Village Hidden in the Sound together with the emissary. But…\\n And then…? We waited for a notice from Arashi, but…\\n There is no word from him, huh? Damn it! He was tricked by that Orochimaru! Naruto! Oh…! Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi might be safe…\\n We don’t know, right? And so…and so…\\n Idiot…! I’m going to save Arashi! I have a small body and my power is weak. So no matter what I did…\\n I did nothing but become a hindrance even in Ninjutsu training…\\n But Arashi always saved me! Everyone in the village has already given up, but…\\n So I’ll find Village Hidden in the Sound alone…\\n And so you were chased by the Sound Ninja, right? This time, it’s my turn to save Arashi! Sasame! I…I want to be of help to Arashi!',\n",
       " 'Naruto! Yeah…I know! We have to go to Village of the Sound to bring back Sasuke anyway, so! Now instead of one,\\n it’s just that there are two guys for us to bring back. I’ll save your cousin, Sasame! Right! Eew! A spider…\\n What’s this?! Naruto! Wha--! What’s this?! Ninja Art: Wind Spiders! My cute children made a path for me out of silver thread\\n and told me where you guys were going. All three of you together will descend into hell while bearing the secret! Naruto! It’s the Ventriloquism Jutsu! He’s scattering his voice to multiple directions\\n and covering up location and number! I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!',\n",
       " 'Okay! Bring it on from anywhere! It’s a large number, but it’s just Clone Jutsu. No. Look closely, Jigumo! The threads are getting tangled. All of the clones are tangible?! Shadow clones?! If so… Kagero! Understood…\\n Come out! Borne to be born, lived to live, one sunrise and one sunset…\\n The life of a mayfly lasts but one day. Thinking that such a fleeting life is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable…\\n Know that I’m at my best\\n when living in the dark and deep in the ground! Ninja Art:\\n Ant Lion Jutsu! When I recalled the parts one by one,\\n I felt as though I had understood everything\\n Faded words which I kept so close to me\\n Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,\\n and this distant yearning for you\\n I live, simply repeating this cycle\\n Held in my two hands A droplet of time\\n Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words\\n I’ll keep these thoughts…\\n Darn it! What a pesky bunch! But I won’t be done in so easily! I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk’s butt\\n and bring back Sasuke and Sasame’s cousin! It doesn’t matter if you guys are powerhouses! I’ll kick all of your butts, so bring it on from anywhere! Next episode, “Pure Betrayal, and a Fleeting Plea!”']"
